# Auto-Search Implementation Guide

We've updated the search functionality to work automatically as you type. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## 1. Debounce Implementation

We've added debounce functionality to ensure the search happens only after the user stops typing for a moment, not on every keystroke. This prevents excessive API calls and provides a smoother user experience.

```javascript
// Custom hook for debouncing values
const useDebounce = (value, delay) => {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set debouncedValue to value after the specified delay
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    // Cancel the timeout if value changes or unmount
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
};
```

## 2. Auto-Search Features

- **Real-time feedback**: The list updates automatically as you type after a short delay (500ms)
- **Better loading indicators**: Clear loading state while searching
- **Optimized performance**: Debouncing prevents excessive API calls
- **Responsive UI**: User gets immediate feedback as they interact with filters

## 3. Affected Components

- **BookList.js**: Includes debouncing for all filter fields
- **CategoryList.js**: Includes debouncing for the search field

## 4. Utility Functions

We've also added a `utilities.js` file with reusable hooks:
- `useDebounce`: For debounced state values
- `formatRupiah`: For consistent price formatting
- `parseRupiah`: For parsing price strings

## How to Use

Simply type in the search/filter fields, and the results will automatically update after a brief pause in typing. No need to click any buttons or press Enter.

These changes follow modern UX best practices for search interfaces, making the application more responsive and user-friendly.
